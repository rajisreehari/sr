$description="This is me. I was prescribed Ativan (a lot of it) after having stomach problems because of anxiety. I became completely physically addicted to the drug and it ended up being way worse than the problem the stupid fucking doctor was trying to fix. He basically wanted me out of his hair. Heâ€™s name was: Shawn Hassler";
