$description="Smoking cessation (colloquially quitting smoking) is the process of discontinuing tobacco smoking. Tobacco contains nicotine that is addictive.[1]
</p>
Smoking cessation can be achieved with or without assistance from healthcare professionals, or the use of medications. However, a combination of personal efforts and medications proves more effective to many smokers.[2] Methods that have been found to be effective include interventions directed at or via health care providers and health care systems; medications including nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and varenicline; individual and group counselling; and Web-based or stand-alone and computer programs. Although stopping smoking can cause short-term side effects such as reversible weight gain, smoking cessation services and activities are cost-effective because of the positive health benefits.
</p>

In a growing number of countries, there are more ex-smokers than smokers.[2]
Early \"failure\" is a normal part of trying to stop, and more than one attempt at stopping smoking prior to longer-term success is common.[2]
NRT, other prescribed pharmaceuticals, and professional counselling or support also help many smokers.[2]
However, up to three-quarters of ex-smokers report having quit without assistance (\"cold turkey\" or cut down then quit), and cessation without professional support or medication may be the most common method used by ex-smokers.[2]
Tobacco contains nicotine. Smoking cigarettes can lead to nicotine addiction.[3]:2300â€“2301 The addiction begins when nicotine acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to release neurotransmitters such as dopamine, glutamate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid.[3]:2296 Cessation of smoking leads to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal such as anxiety and irritability.[3]:2298 Professional smoking cessation support methods generally endeavour to address both nicotine addiction and nicotine withdrawal symptoms.

Studies have shown that it takes between 6 to 12 weeks post quitting before the amount of nicotinic receptors in the brain return to the level of a non smoker.[4]";
