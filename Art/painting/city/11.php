$description="Homeschooling is the education of children outside the formal settings of public or private schools and is usually undertaken directly by parents or tutors. Despite the name, only a portion of home education may be delivered in the family home, with the rest being provided within the local community or elsewhere. Many families who start out with a formal school structure at home often switch to less formal and more effective ways of delivering education outside of school and prefer the term \"home education\" to \"homeschooling\".[1] Homeschooling is the term commonly used in North America, while home education is more commonly used in the British Isles,[2] elsewhere in Europe and in many Commonwealth countries.

Although prior to the introduction of compulsory school attendance laws most childhood education occurred within the family or community,[3] homeschooling in the modern sense is an alternative in developed countries to attending public or private schools and is a legal option for parents in many countries.
</p>
Parents cite two main motivations for homeschooling their children: dissatisfaction with the local schools and the interest to be more involved with, and have a greater say, in their children's learning and development. Dissatisfaction with available schools includes concerns about the school environment, the quality of academic instruction, the curriculum being followed, bullying and parents' lack of faith in the school's ability to cater adequately for their child's special needs. Some parents homeschool to have greater control over what and how their children are taught, to better cater for children's individual aptitudes and abilities, to provide a specific religious or moral instruction and to take advantage of the efficiency of one-to-one instruction to free the child to spend more time on childhood activities, socializing and non-academic learning. Many are also influenced by alternative educational philosophies espoused by the likes of Susan Sutherland Isaacs, Charlotte Mason,John Holt, and Sir Kenneth Robinson, among others.
</p>
Homeschooling may also be a factor in the choice of parenting style. Homeschooling can be an option for families living in isolated rural locations, temporarily abroad and for those who travel frequently. Many young athletes, actors and musicians are taught at home to better fit in their training and practice schedules. Homeschooling can be about mentorship and apprenticeship, where a tutor or teacher is with the child for many years, therefore getting to know the child very well. Recently, homeschooling has increased in popularity in the United States, and the percentage of children 5-17 who are homeschooled increased from 1.7% in 1999 to 2.9% in 2007.[4]
</p>
Homeschooling can be used as a form of supplementary education and a way of helping children learn in specific circumstances. Homeschooling may also refer to instruction in the home under the supervision of correspondence schools or umbrella schools. In some places, an approved curriculum is legally required if children are to be homeschooled.[5] A curriculum-free philosophy of homeschooling is sometimes called unschooling, a term coined in 1977 by American educator and author John Holt in his magazine Growing Without Schooling. In some cases, a liberal arts education is provided using the trivium and quadrivium as the main models.";
