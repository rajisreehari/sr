$description="Hollywood /hɒliwʊd/ is a district in the central region of Los Angeles, California, in the United States.
</p>
It is notable for its place as the home of the entertainment industry, including several of its historic studios. Its name has come 
to be a metonym for the motion picture industry of the United States. Hollywood is also a highly ethnically diverse, densely populated, 
economically diverse neighborhood and retail business district.
</p>

Hollywood was a small community in 1870 and was incorporated as a municipality in 1903.[1][2] It officially merged with the city of Los Angeles
 in 1910, and soon thereafter a prominent film industry began to emerge, eventually becoming the most dominant and recognized in the world.[3][4]";
