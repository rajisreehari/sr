$description="Fox News Channel (FNC), also known as Fox News, is an American basic cable and satellite news television channel that is owned by the Fox Entertainment Group subsidiary of 21st Century Fox. As of August 2013, approximately 97,186,000 American households (85.1% of cable, satellite & telco customers) receive the Fox News Channel.[1] The channel broadcasts primarily from studios at Rockefeller Center in New York City.
</p>
The channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who hired former NBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO.[2] It launched on October 7, 1996,[3] to 17 million cable subscribers.[4] It grew during the late 1990s and 2000s to become the dominant cable news network in the United States.[5]
</p>
Many observers have said Fox News Channel promotes conservative political positions[6] and biased reporting.[7][8] Commentators, news anchors, and reporters at Fox News Channel have responded that news reporting and political commentary operate independently of each other and have denied any bias in news reporting.[9]";
