$description="The term \"migrant worker\" has different official meanings and connotations in different parts of the world. The United Nations' definition is broad, including any people working outside of their home country. Some of these are called expatriates. Several countries have millions of foreign workers. Some have millions of illegal immigrants, most of them being workers also.
<br>
The term can also be used to describe someone who migrates within a country, possibly their own, in order to pursue work such as seasonal work.";
