$description="This is a large painting with impressive facial features. The premise for this painting is a boy a knew 
in Hayes Valley, San Francisco CA USA. Today Hayes Valley is: <i>Hayes Valley is a fashionable neighborhood in the Western 
Addition district of San Francisco, California. It is located between the historical districts of Alamo Square and the Civic 
Center.</i> Not when I lived there. This kids was black and smoked like a chimney. He lived on the streets and politely asked 
for change every morning on my way to work. He’d say stuff like: ‘I need some cigs, would you mind?’ or ‘I need bus fair’. 
Anyhow here is my representation of him and the 2 years that I consistently saw him there.
