$description="Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and musically influential groups in the history of popular music.
</p>
Founded in 1965, Pink Floyd originally consisted of students Syd Barrett, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright. They first gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene during the late 1960s, and under Barrett's creative leadership they released two charting singles and a successful debut album. David Gilmour joined as a fifth member in December 1967; Barrett left the band in April 1968 owing to his deteriorating mental health. After Barrett's departure, Waters became the band's primary lyricist, and by the mid-1970s, their dominant songwriter, devising the original concepts behind their critically and commercially acclaimed albums The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983).

Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd and Wright subsequently joined them as a paid musician and later once again a full member. They continued to record and tour through 1994; two more albums followed, A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994). Inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005, by 2013 they had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, including 74.5 million certified units in the United States.

After nearly two decades of acrimony, Pink Floyd reunited in 2005 for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8. In 2006, Gilmour was interviewed for an article printed in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that declared that Pink Floyd had dissolved. When asked about their future, Gilmour explained that the band was finished making music, and that at the age of 60 he preferred to work on his own. Since then, both he and Waters have repeatedly insisted that they have no plans to reunite with the surviving former members. Barrett died in 2006 and Wright in 2008. In 2011, Gilmour and Mason joined Waters at one of his The Wall Tour shows at The O2 Arena in London.

On July 5, 2014, multiple individuals, including Gilmour's spouse, announced that a new studio album based around recordings made in 1994, said to be the \"swan song\" of Wright and titled The Endless River, was scheduled for release in October of that year.";
