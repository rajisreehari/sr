$description="Parliament is a brand of cigarettes marketed by the company Philip Morris. The brand was introduced in 1931 and is distinctive for its recessed paper filters.[1] It was originally used as an advertising gimmick when cigarettes did not have filters. The first commercial cigarette filters came into use in 1935. Cigarette filters became common in most cigarettes in the 1950s. In the 1940s and 1950s, the brand was marketed for its unique filters, with advertisements reading, \"Only the flavor touches your lips\", and \"Tobacco tastes best when the filter's recessed\".[2] The brand also claimed that the recessed filter prevented tar from making contact with the smoker's mouth, unlike standard filters.[3] The Parliament brand holds a strong market position in Georgia, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Argentina, Israel, South Korea, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Russia, Montenegro, Ukraine, and the United States.[4]";
