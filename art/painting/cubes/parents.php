$description="This painting is about my Father reading the news paper, my mother holding my 
sister and I and my mother taking her first communion. I sold it to this fellow from Los Angeles 
China town. He came by the house one afternoon, picked up 2 paintings, strapped them to his ultra 
expensive SUV and drove away never to be seen again. I hope to see this painting again some day.";
