$description="This is a painting of my little sister Carla Maria Spiropulo. 
I traded it for another painting to a painter in Los Angeles (Carla didn't want it). 
This other fellow was heavily addicted to speed and cocaine. I highly doubt he still have 
this painting. He either painted over it sold it or burned it to light up his crack pipe.";
