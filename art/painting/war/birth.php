$description="The birth rate is the total number of births per 1,000 of a population each year.[1] The rate of births in a population is calculated in several ways: live births from a universal registration system for births, deaths, and marriages; population counts from a census, and estimation through specialized demographic techniques. The birth rate (along with mortality and migration rate) are used to calculate population growth.
</p>
The crude birth rate is the number of births per 1,000 people per year.[2] Another term used interchangeably with birth rate is natality.[3] When the crude death rate is subtracted from the crude birth rate, the result is the rate of natural increase (RNI).[4] This is equal to the rate of population change (excluding migration).[4]
</p>

The total (crude) birth rate (which includes all births)—typically indicated as births per 1,000 population—is distinguished from an age-specific rate (the number of births per 1,000 persons in an age group).[5] The first known use of the term \"birth rate\" in English occurred in 1859.[6]
</p>

In 2012 the average global birth rate was 19.15 births per 1,000 total population,[8] compared to 20.09 per 1,000 total population in 2007.[9]
