Working in both public and private schools for more than 13 years, I have experienced a variety of academic cultures and have gained insight, 
empathy, and a broad understanding of the vital roles played by students, parents, teachers, and administration. I leverage this knowledge 
through my role as an <u>educational therapist</u>  - whether in one-on-one student sessions, as a collaborating team member, or client advocate.   

My goal is to foster a nurturing and supportive climate for students so that successful learning can occur.
