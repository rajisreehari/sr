As an <u>educational therapist</u>, my relationship with the student is first and foremost.  It is essential that I am sensitive to the learner as a person. In doing this, 
I provide thoughtful, relevant, therapeutic approaches so that the student feels safe and valued as we learn together. From the moment the student walks through the door, I meet 
them where they are, at that moment. This means giving him or her the space to reflect on the day or discuss a particular problem, if they are experiencing conflict.  As a result, 
our relationship grows, his/her brain is more open to receiving, and with time successful consolidated learning happens.
<p>
My relationship with the parent is equally important. The “right fit” is essential so that the important work with the student can unfold.  The parent and I create a vital link, yet 
maintain our own unique and separate roles.  This link offers an opportunity to collaborate and communicate about “our” learner, and I provide a path to facilitate just that.
<p>
All students learn differently and at different paces.  As an <u>educational therapist</u>, I validate this by utilizing an eclectic, <u>multisensory approach</u> to learning. This means I instruct 
using a variety of programs, materials and strategies that I specifically tailor to meet the unique needs of each individual learner. I plan, implement, and assess each session to determine 
the best course of action for a learning exercise – which may mean taking a step back, focusing on the present, or moving forward together. As a result, the student learns at their own pace 
and experiences success.  Over time, the student begins to transfer these newly learned skills into the classroom and other settings where learning occurs. 
This is the goal of <u>educational therapy</u>.
